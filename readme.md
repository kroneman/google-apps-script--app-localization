# Google Apps script - app localization

One of the standards i've come across in app development is i18n files for react and vue

- [vue-i18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/)
- [react-i18n-and-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/)

While these work great and the react version even has a service offering, sometimes its nice to just use google drive (with some of their services)
